# fire-emblem-matcher
Optimizing character pairings.

### Description

Matching Fire Emblem characters can be complicated -  especially if you care about good supports, the child's hair colour AND making the best possible child unit for combat.

This program is designed to help players out.

###Galeâ€“Shapley algorithm

<code>fire-emblem-matcher</code> uses the Gale-Shapley algorithm to make matches.
With this algorithm the 'men' or the group proposing typically ends up with a matches that are higher up in their preference list than the 'women' or the group being proposed to.

Thefore in Awakening the proposer group should be the <b>female</b> characters, but in Fates in should be the <b>male</b> thereby prioritizing child-bearing units (so to speak) ensuring that they get the best possible matches.

###Issues

Cannot handle Fire Emblem list:

  <ol>
  <li>For multiple branches of fates <code>propose_to</code> and <code>respond_to</code> methods need to be able to handle non-existent preferences.</li>
  
  <li>Requires full range of preferences but this does not reflect reality where some characters cannot match (ie. Laslow-Sakura or any siblings). May fixed with change to above</li>
  </ol>
