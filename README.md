###Issues

Cannot handle Fire Emblem list:

  1) For managing  multpile branches of fates <code>propose_to</code> and <code>respond_to</code> methods need to be able to handle non-existent preferences
  2) Requires full range of preferences but this does not reflect reality where some characters cannot match (ie. Laslow-Sakura or any siblings). May fixed with change to above.
