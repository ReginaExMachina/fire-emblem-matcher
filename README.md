### Description

Matching Fire Emblem characters can be complicated. It doesn't get any easier if you care about good supports AND making the best possible child unit for combat.

This program is designed to help players out!

## Getting Started

TBA.

### History

## Galeâ€“Shapley algorithm

The first verison of <code>fire-emblem-matchmaker</code> used the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem">Gale-Shapley</a> algorithm to make matches.

With this algorithm the 'men' (or the group of proposers) typically end up with matches higher up in their preference list than the 'women' (aka the group evaluating proposals). Thus the proposer group is male in Fates and female in Awakening in order to prioritize stronger children units.

However requiring both sets of characters to have preferences with all possible characters did not reflect the actual situation in the game, and changes to compensate for this lead to [breaking issues](Issues) in the final program.

## Munkres aka The Hungarian Method

Attempting to resolve this problem, the second version will use the [Hungarian method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm).

### Issues

**Major Issue** 07/06/16 Recording no match possible for some characters despite having free options available. Issue compounded when player picks a partner unit as a fiance. Currently looking into different algorithm options to resolve this issue...

* Conquest branch appears to be completely unaffected by this glitch, so long as the player picks a male or 'Kamui-sexual' as their fiance.
