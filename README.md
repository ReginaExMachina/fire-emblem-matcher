###Description

Matching Fire Emblem characters can be complicated. It doesn't get any easier if you care about good supports AND making the best possible child unit for combat.

This program is designed to help players out.

##Getting Started

TBA.

###Galeâ€“Shapley algorithm

<code>fire-emblem-matchmaker</code> uses the Gale-Shapley algorithm to make matches.

With this algorithm the 'men' (or the group of proposers) typically end up with matches higher up in their preference list than the 'women' (aka the group evaluating proposals.).

That means we can prioritize the child-bearing units (so to speak) ensuring that they get the best possible matches. Thus in Awakening the proposer group is the female characters, but in Fates it's the males.

###Issues

**Major Issue** 07/06/16 Recording no match possible for some characters despite having free options available. Issue compounded when player picks a partner unit as a fiance. Currently looking into different algorithm options to resolve this issue...

* Conquest branch appears to be completely unaffected by this glitch, so long as the player picks a male or 'Kamui-sexual' as their fiance.
